            <p style="color:navy;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:18px;"> computing is an emerging discipline that combines computer graphics, computer vision, and interactive techniques to advance technologies for the acquisition, analysis, manipulation, and creation of 2D or 3D visual content. This specialization of the professional master's program trains visual data scientists and engineers who apply a deep knowledge of computer science to develop cutting-edge tools, stimulate product innovation, and explore new technology fronts in all commercial, engineering, and creative professions. Students are well-prepared to become software developers and architects in areas including computer graphics, computer vision, imaging sciences, AR/VR, and computer-aided design and manufacturing.</p>
